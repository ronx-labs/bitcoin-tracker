## Pros

1. Modularity:
   - The code is split into different files (`main.rs` and `codec.rs`). This makes it easier to manage and add new features. Each part has a clear job, like how `codec.rs` handles the encoding and decoding of Bitcoin messages.

2. Async Programming:
   - It uses `tokio` for asynchronous operations, which is perfect for networking tasks like communicating with Bitcoin nodes. This enables the program to handle multiple tasks at once without getting stuck.

3. Error Handling:
   - The `anyhow` crate makes error handling straightforward, which is very useful for tracking issues.
   - It's good practice that it has defined the custom `Error` enum by categorizing different errors that might happen during the connection and handshake.

4. Testing:
   - There's a unit test (`test_codec_round_trip`) that checks if the encoding and decoding part are working correctly. This is very important for making sure the `BitcoinCodec` is reliable and avoid unexpected issues for maintaing and scaling to a big project.

5. Logging:
   - The `init_tracing` function sets up logging with the `tracing` and `tracing_subscriber` crates, which enables well-formatted logs.

6. Modern Rust Practices:
   - The code uses modern Rust practices, like `futures::StreamExt` and `SinkExt` for handling async streams.

## Cons

1. Scalability:
    - The current structure is not good enough for scailability. In order to scale the project efficiently, we need more separation of concerns.
    - The following is my suggestion
        ─ main.rs
        - network.rs  // Contains connection logic including handshake
        - messages.rs  // Contains message building functions
        - errors.rs  // Contains error definitions
        - utils.rs  // Contains utility functions
        - config.rs // Contains config info including global constant values

2. Error Handling:
   - While `anyhow::Result` is easy to use, it can hide specific error details. We can utilize `thiserror` to handle different errors differently.
   - The error handling in `perform_handshake` is not clear enough. If the expected `VersionMessage` isn’t received, it just says `ConnectionLost`, which is not helpful for debugging. It’d be nice if it provided more details about the error.

3. Readability:
   - Some constants (`USER_AGENT` and `START_HEIGHT`) are defined inside `build_version_message` function. Moving them into `config.rs` would make them easier to read and maintain.

4. Risk of Infinite Loops:
   - A loop inside `perfom_handshake` function can run into infinite loop, if a bad node keeps sending unsupported messages. Adding a limit would be helpful to avoid this.

5. Not Handling Edge Cases:
   - The code assumes the first message after sending a `VersionMessage` will be another `VersionMessage`. That’s usually true, but not always, which could cause issues if another message comes first. I think if a node receives unsupported messages for a certain number of times, it should restart handshake process again.

6. IPv6 and Tor Addresses:
   - The code doesn’t filter out IPv6 and Tor addresses, which could lead to unnecessary connection attempts.

7. Test Error Handling:
   - The `test_codec_round_trip` test could be better by using `Result` instead of just `unwrap`. This would give more useful error messages if an error occurs during the test.
